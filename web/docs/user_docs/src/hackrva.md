# HackRVA

HackRVA is a local hackerspace/makerspace with over 160 members and we are entirely community driven.

We have been around in some form or fashion since 2009 and we have made the badges for RVAsec for somewhere around/over a decade.


## Open house
We typically have open house every Thursday at 7-9pm.

We just signed a lease for a new space and are in the process of moving.

> our move should be completed by the end of June 2023
